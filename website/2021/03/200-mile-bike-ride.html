                    <p>On Saturday, March 20 2021 I completed 200 mile bike ride. In all, it was great day &amp; I
                        enjoyed the ride. See the

                    <h3 id="the-why">the why</h3>
                    <p>I did it for a couple reasons. Mainly:</p>
                    <ul type="1">
                        <li>I like doing physical challenges just to see if I can do them - like <a
                                href="https://www.strava.com/activities/4243122271">running all the famous hills in
                                SF</a> or <a href="https://suczewski.com/2020/05/ggp-ironman.html">biking 112 miles
                                around the 0.75 mile Golden Gate Park
                                cycing track</a> and more</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3248542017">My friend Morgan did a 400km
                                ride</a>
                            &amp; that was
                            inspiring … so I figured if he can do 400km, I can at least do 200mi!</li>
                        <li>The ironman bike leg is 112 miles so maybe if I did 200 miles, 112 miles would feel
                            short. I
                            did something
                            similar by running a trail ultramarathon before my first marathon in 2019.</li>
                        <li>I just felt like biking. Sometimes I think to myself, “I just want to bike all day” … so
                            I
                            tried it! It’s nice
                            being outside, taking it all in, seeing the scenes, &amp; letting your mind wander.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Here’s the route &amp; the landmarks I wanted to pass by:</p>

                    <h3 id="some-thoughts">some thoughts</h3>
                    <p>This was a nice route! Here’s are some thoughts -</p>
                    <p>I got off to an early start in the dark. I always like running &amp; riding in the dark
                        before
                        the world wakes up.
                        Cañada road north &amp; Ocean Beach SF were beautiful.</p>

                    <img class="bike-200-img" src="/static/200-tt.jpg" />
                    <br />
                    my bike ... in the dark
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <p>I was trying to keep my pacing conservative, but I found myself in a 2 man paceline near Sam
                        Taylor park north &amp;
                        couldn’t let my new friend down! Whatever excess energy I spent there was worth it, since it
                        was
                        a great ~8 mile
                        stretch of lively, net-downhill, 25-30 mph riding.</p>
                    <p>In Tomales, I stopped at a 7-11 for refreshments &amp; made a birthday phone call. When I I
                        got
                        back on my bike, I had a flat tire. I changed it &amp; got another flat – I hadn’t checked
                        the
                        tire &amp; there was a
                        metal shard in it.
                        Since I blew two tubes, I needed more. I went to 2 bike shops that were closed, but the 3rd
                        shop
                        had the tubes I
                        needed. This was the nadir of ride – I was 83 miles in, a bit tired, &amp; had just spent
                        close
                        to an hour dealing
                        with tubes &amp; re-supply. It was between 12pm &amp; 1pm and I was worried about making
                        back
                        before dark (2 of my 3
                        lights had died). Luckily though, the stop was an opportunity to rest &amp; I felt good when
                        I
                        got back to it ... I eventually got home while there was JUST enough light to get by. </p>
                    <p>Logistically, this weekend worked well for me to do this ride so I wanted to seize the
                        opportunity. But, I had broken
                        the derailleur, derailleur hanger, chain, &amp; rear wheel on my standard road bike
                        the week before …
                        so I did the ride on my time trial bike. I like my time trial bike &amp; am fine w/ the
                        aggressive positioning. It
                        likely helped too in some of the windy sections!</p>
                    <p><img class="bike-200-img" src="/static/200-broken.jpg" /><br />road bike ... not ready for
                        the
                        double century
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>The wind! Usually it’s the case that I blame headwinds from slowing me down &amp; take all
                        the
                        credit for tailwinds.
                        HOWEVER … today was different. The stretch from Petaluma to Tomales had a ripping headwind –
                        BUT
                        the next 100 miles
                        from Tomales to the SF peninsula had a tailwind helping me out.</p>
                    <p><img class="bike-200-img" src="/static/200-tomales.jpg" /> <br />in Tomales ... see the wind
                        on
                        the water ... how many snickers in am i?<br /></p>
                    <p>I don’t REALLY think that hard about fueling &amp; nutrition. On this ride I ate EIGHT
                        snickers
                        bars, 2 banannas, a
                        bag of chips, 2 gels, &amp; an apple. Sometimes water &amp; sometimes gatorade. I meant to
                        stop
                        for proper food, but
                        was somewhat worried about the time and was loving the snickers and that’s just what I
                        wanted
                        and
                        was feeling good.</p>
                    <p>Based on my prior riding I guessed that 180 W was probably a safe power output that I could
                        hold
                        for
                        ~12 hours. I want to race
                        the Ironman at 230-250 W so I figured I would slash a bit off that. In terms of “perceived
                        effort,” I thought to
                        myself that if any point my effort felt harder than a challenging, all-day hike, I was
                        riding
                        too hard. Using a
                        power meter helped me show restraint in the early miles.</p>
                    <p>Doing efforts like this solo makes it easy to go at your own pace, stop when you feel like
                        it,
                        ride when you feel
                        like it, &amp; deviate from the plan. I was worried I would not be able to complete the ride
                        &amp; did not want any
                        social pressure to get myself injured &amp; didn’t want to rope anyone into logistically
                        supporting my
                        personal
                        challenges. That said, could
                        definitely be fun to do with friends next time!</p>
                    <p><img class="bike-200-img" src="/static/200-frisco.jpg" /> <br /></p>
                    <p>I made some rounding errors &amp; was going to be short on hitting 200 miles by the time I
                        returned home … so did 15 miles of
                        laps on the Golden
                        Gate Park cycle track. This was fun since I was able to pick up
                        my power late into
                        the ride (miles ~150 - ~170) and hit these 15 miles at 22.2mph. This was encouraging for
                        my
                        Ironman since this
                        was good velocity on tired legs.</p>
                    <p><img class="bike-200-img" src="/static/200-ggp.png" /> <br />a nice 15 mile pick-up from
                        155m-170mi ...
                        and picking up the speed helped me
                        get home by dark!</p>
                    <p>Overall, pacing was the biggest thing that made this ride enjoyable. I’ve had 60 or 80 or 100
                        mile rides that were FAR worse
                        than this. Here, I
                        started convervatively, ended feeling pretty good, and got it done. I’ve been doing 1 100
                        mile
                        every month from
                        January to June in preparation for my June Ironman & have been getting better at these types
                        of
                        long effort.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="whats-next">what’s next</h3>
                    <p>Next, I’m focused on race-specific training for an Ironman June 27th &amp; will save other
                        big
                        personal endurance
                        challenges for after that. I will likely try to do an Everest ride in July or August.</p>
                    <p>After this ride, I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sK0bsQ7A7Q">this GCN
                            video</a> about STAGE 1
                        1903 Tour de France … it was 467km / 290mi! I had no idea how different the race was then.
                        The
                        guys in the GCN video
                        ride it on
                        1903-style equipment &amp; it looks like a blast. It would be fun to do something wild like
                        that
                        with a friend.</p>
                    <p>I mentioned my very broken road bike – I’ve decided to disassemble every part &amp; paint it.
                        We’ll see how it goes.
                        Excited for my new old bike!</p>
