          <p>This article is focuses on biking data &amp; training targets and is meant to serve as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a personal reference for calibrating future race targets &amp; fitness challenges</li>
            <li>a reference for helping others calibrate future race targets &amp; fitness challenges based on their
              relative fitness metrics</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This makes me care about things like how my bike sounds, my <a
              href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/what-is-threshold-power/" target="_blank">FTP</a>, GPS accuracy,
            wind speed, whether or not I cleaned my drive train and other things most people don’t care about. Thoughts
            here are generally scattered – I’d like to write more structured articles about training, performance &amp;
            prediction soon.</p>

          <p>On May 2nd 2020, I was scheduled to race an Ironman in St George, Utah near Zion National Park. I was
            excited for the trip – I had been looking forward to spending time with my family &amp; girlfriend and my
            training had been coming along.</p>

          <p>The race &amp; the trip were unfortunately cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, I wanted to put
            in a good race-like effort on the day the race would have happened.</p>

          <p>I decided to do a “shelter in place” Ironman bike leg and ride 112 miles at the ~0.7 mile cycle track in
            Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.</p>

            <li>wanted to prove I am nuts</li>

          <p>I trained a bunch for the Ironman – maybe I’ll write about it in another post &amp; share training
            resources. My goal was to qualify for the Ironman world championship in Kona via a top ~1-3 age group finish
            for M25-29 at the North American Championship in St. George.</p>

          <p>I’m probably not there yet, but am getting close.</p>

            My biking <a href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/what-is-threshold-power/" target="_blank">FTP</a> was
            348 W about a month before this time trial. I paced the FTP test convervatively though – my 5 minute splits
            were ~350 W, ~360 W, ~380 W, ~390 W. I’d guess I could hold 380 W for 20 minutes which would make an FTP of
            360 W. Maybe I couldn’t though. My FTP is definitely above 350 W and maybe closer to 360 W.</p>

          <p>I weighed 165 lbs = ~75 kg for the FTP test and the time trial. An FTP of 350 - 360 puts me at a W / kg of
            4.6 - 4.8. This is getting me close to Kona Q territory. But extrapolating a 20 minute test to an Ironman is
            noisy. I might also want to race at 160 lbs but 165 lbs is good for the trial.</p>

          <p>Online calculators suggested I could hold 230 W - 250 W for an Ironman and that I should be good for about
            23 mph or maybe a little less. I figured 23 mph was a nice round number, so I made that my “A” goal. 23 mph
            is 4 hrs 52 mins, which is close to 5 hours, so 5 hours was my “B” goal. 10 minutes seemed like a good
            buffer, so 5:10 was my “C” goal.</p>

          <p>To make a strong Kona bid, I probably want to hit at least 23 mph / 4:40 - 4:50 on a road course with hills
            and such. So this would be a good test!</p>

          <p>I did the trial on a ~2007 cervelo P3 with deep race wheels. I wore a tri suit &amp; aero helmet. I stayed
            on the aero bars the entire ride, except when quickly getting gels or blocks or gatorade from my pocket or
            bike. I didn’t carry a flat kit since I was just doing laps. I carried 3 gatorade bottles - 1 on the frame
            and 2 on the saddle. I had 3 gels in my pocket and 2 packs of blocks. I also carried my phone for music.</p>

          <p>I tuned and fully cleaned my bike in the week leading up to the trial. I cleaned the casette, chain, and
            drive train. I reset the derailers and breaks. Re-tapped a stripped dropout screw hole in the frame for
            setting the rear wheel position. Unstuck a stuck seat post. Re-taped some of the handle bars. I lowered my
            front bars one extra notch and raised my seat a bit for aero. This bike has come together slowly in parts
            from craigslist &amp; ebay and I am very happy with it after a lot of work.</p>

          <p>The bike cleaning alone may have given me 0.5 - 1.0 mph. And the aero gear maybe another 0.5 - 1.0 mph.
            Hard to say, especially since I would later discover the power data from this ride was garbage.</p>

          <p>I did it! Probably! I hit 4:46 for the Ironman and averaged 23.5 mph according to my GPS data. The strava
            effort is a little longer since i did an extra lap in case there was some later rounding error. GPS might
            not be that accurate and I might be a few minutes slower. But close-ish.</p>

          <p>I measured the ride with a Garmin Forerunner 935. It may have been more accurate to count laps instead of
            relying on GPS. I was mostly riding on the inside lane of the track, though sometimes on the outside lane.
          </p>

          <p>I might be off by ~1 mile (~2 min 38 s) due to the accuracy of GPS while doing tight circles. My time for
            the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3386880806/segments/2691729413540492965" target="_blank">100
              mile GGP strava segment</a> suggests I might be closer to 23.2 mph which extrapolates to 4:49:40 for 112
            miles. But the last 12 miles were below the average for the ride, so maybe slower overall. Lap-by-lap Strava
            analysis shows I might be closer to 22.9 mph.</p>

          <p>I also did a 5k run after the bike ride at 6:46 min / mile (2:58 marathon pace). That was hard! I want to
            run sub 3 (or close to it) for the Ironman marathon, which I realize now will be a huge challenge
            considering how hard that pace was for a 5k. My marathon PR is 2:39 (6:06 pace), though I got hurt earlier
            this year and haven’t been running high mileage – I’m probably in ~2:50 shape now.</p>

          <p>my general thoughts were:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>yay! this was actually great. I had a blast and would do it again once I think I can hit a strong new PR
            </li>
            <li>really nice to not have to stop at all. i rode this straight thru the 4 hr 48 mins and only touched the
              breaks once for another cyclist</li>
            <li>Need to get stronger for the Kona Q – want to hit this effort on real course and run a solid marathon
              after. Maybe a nice day with no rain and mist, a functional power meter, fixing noises on the bike,
              adequate fueling, conservative pacing, and a race environment will help? Doesn’t hurt to just get
              stronger.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of talking to myself like “85! YOU GOT THIS! TOO EASY! SEND IT HOME!”. this was probably was
              obnoxious for other folks at the park but that’s ok. i listened to mostly country music the whole ride,
              though my headphone batteries died after 4 hours. i’ve thought about crossing my Garmin data with my <a
                href="https://suczewski.com/2018/12/spotify.html" target="_blank">spotify logger</a> data, maybe one
              day.</li>
            <li>I went out hard … i hit ~2:15 for the half ironman and was averaging 24.5 mph for a lot of the early 5
              mile splits. at mile 30, i could feel i was working too hard. It was cool to beat my santa cruz half
              ironman time by 20 minutes in the first half. This trial was flat and I rode a TT bike in aero position
              vs. rolling hills &amp; road bike at santa cruz, but I’m also stronger.</li>
            <li>I’m glad a went out hard rather than conservatively so that 1) I had a shot to greatly exceed my goal
              (e.g. hitting 4:30) and 2) I was forced to push through the fatigue for miles 70 - 112 &amp; build
              toughness. “<a target="_blank"
                href="https://smile.amazon.com/Endure-Curiously-Elastic-Limits-Performance/dp/0062499866">Endure</a>”
              discussed this type of hard early pacing, so I just thought about the book during the ride and how I
              should enjoy any pain</li>
            <li>My heart rate was generally 130 - 140 during the ride, later creeping up to 140 - 150. Usually I cannot
              ride 23 mph @ 135 bpm but today I could which was cool. My heart rate hit 31 the night before which was
              low. Usually is like 33 - 37 bpm while sleeping.</li>
            <li>It might have gotten windy? Hard to know if it was fatigue or wind. Power meter is useless. Power meter
              says I am 66% left foot at 175 W. I definitely have reasonably equal pedal laterality and am closer to
              220-260 W based on physics of moving 165 lbs + 22 lbs @ 23 mph. Power meter cut out a bunch of times has
              been generally broken. I have gotten 2 parts kits from the the manufacturer to fix defects, but it is
              still bad.</li>
            <li>Next time, might want to figure out counting laps vs. using GPS and how to approach that</li>
            <li>On the Tuesday before, I squatted &amp; deadlifted, ran 5 miles @ 5:48 / mile, &amp; biked 25 miles. My
              legs were still sore Saturday, especially since I haven’t really been lifting. But glad i just went for it
              and sucked it up and pedaled depite the fatigue</li>
            <li>Road was wet and air was misty for the first ~2.5 hours, but made for a really nice temperature, not
              getting thristy, etc. My bike started creaking and sounding terrible thought after ~2.5 hours, maybe from
              wet weather?</li>
            <li>The monotony actually wasn’t that big of a deal compared to just the total level of exertion. Aggressive
              early pacing caused more strain than doing hundreds of that same lap</li>
            <li>I didn’t eat enough and didn’t bring enough snacks for the ride. I had 3 gels, 2 packs of blocks, and 1
              bottle of gatorade which probably wasn’t enough. I had 2 more gatorades available but didn’t want to use
              the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I crossed paths with a coyote right outside my door in SF as I was leaving at 5:30 am. And made friends
              with a cat while getting ready at the track. We saw turtles the evening before. Those were cool!</li>
