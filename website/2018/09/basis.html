          <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

          <p>Some friends of mine are building <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basis.io/">Basis</a>, a price-stable
            cryptocurrency. To learn more about the protocol and the broader ecosystem, I implemented a naive
            implementation of Basis in December 2017. Here’s what I did &amp; what I learned.</p>

          <p>See all my code at <a target="_blank"
              href="https://github.com/adamlouis/naiive-coin">adamlouis/naiive-coin</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="my-work">My Work</h3>

          <h4 id="protocol-summary">Protocol summary</h4>

          <p>First, I’ll give a summary of the Basis protocol as described in <a target="_blank"
              href="https://www.basis.io/static/basis_whitepaper_en.pdf">the whitepaper</a>:</p>

          <p>There exist 3 tokens in the system: coins, shares, and bonds. The system attempts to keep the price of a
            coin pegged to some arbitrary value. The Basis team has chosen 1 USD as the target coin price.</p>

          <p>The coin-USD exchange price is provided to the system via an oracle feed. If the USD-coin price is lower
            than $1, the system contracts the coin supply to raise the coin-USD price. If the USD-coin price exceeds $1,
            the system expands coin supply to reduce the coin-USD price.</p>

          <p>With a $1 target price, the re-balancing process should restore the system to a state where the number of
            coins in the system is equal to the market cap, assuming a price elasticity of 1.</p>

          <p><strong>To contract coin supply</strong>, the system holds a bond auction in which coin holders can
            purchase bonds using coins. Bonds either:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>pay out 1 coin when the system expands</li>
            <li>expire if no such expansion is required in time</li>
          </ol>

          <p>“Bond” is a misnomer for these instruments, as they have characteristics of both options and bonds. They’re
            not bonds - they’re something new.</p>

          <p><strong>To expand coin supply</strong>, the system first pays out coins to all bond holders in the order
            the bonds were purchased. If all bond holders have been paid, the remaining coins are distributed to
            shareholders pro-rata.</p>

          <p>That’s it! Read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.basis.io/static/basis_whitepaper_en.pdf">the white
              paper</a> or Basis’ resources for more information.</p>

          <h4 id="implementation">Implementation</h4>

          <p>In December 2017, I implemented the 3 token system of shares, coins, and bonds as a <strong><a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/adamlouis/naiive-coin/blob/master/contracts/Basecoin.sol">single Ethereum smart
                contract</a></strong>. My main goals were to better understand the Basis protocol and the greater
            cryptocurrency space by actually doing something. I make no attempt at a production implementation. See all
            my code at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/adamlouis/naiive-coin">adamlouis/naiive-coin</a>.</p>

          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/adamlouis/naiive-coin/blob/master/contracts/Basecoin.sol"><code
                class="highlighter-rouge">contracts/Basecoin.sol</code></a> contains the solidity implementation. The
            protocol as described above and in the whitepaper runs off 5 salient write functions:</p>

          <figure class="highlight">
            <pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="c1">// transfer `value` shares from `to` to `msg.sender`</span>

<span class="c1">// read the oracle price and expand or contract the coin supply accordingly</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">tick</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre>
          </figure>

          <p>This API captures the basics of the system. I cut corners where possible &amp; favored simple, naiive
            approaches over complicated but efficient ones. Check out <a target="_blank"
              href="https://github.com/adamlouis/naiive-coin">the code</a> and comments for details.</p>

          <p>In addition to the smart contract, I wrote a <strong><a target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/adamlouis/naiive-coin/blob/master/src/App.js">React web
                application</a></strong> that is a dashboard of the Basecoin system. From this dashboard, one can:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>view coin, share, and bond holdings</li>
            <li>interact with the smart contract</li>
          </ol>

          <p>I built this using the <a>truffle framework</a>. Truffle makes it easy to build javascript web apps that
            interact with solidity smart contracts.</p>

          <p>I put this smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain in July 2018 at <a target="_blank"

          <h3 id="my-learnings">My Learnings</h3>

          <h4 id="on-basis">On Basis</h4>

          <p>Here are some of my thoughts on Basis after working on this project:</p>

          <p><strong>philosophical</strong></p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Price volatility of Bitcoin, Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies will be an impediment for their mass
                adoption as money. Even if their price volatility matched that of gold (~10% per year), they would still
                be unsuitable for commerce and long term financial contracts. Money is the “killer app” of blockchain
                and any cryptocurrency that ultimately achieves widespread use as money will have low price (purchasing
                power) volatility. This is great news for Basis! There is need for a stablecoin in a world with
                cryptocurrency.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Success of Basis is highly dependent on consumer distribution &amp; utility. The likely first users are
                cryptocurrency traders. Expansion beyond a technically sophisticated audience though will be challenging
                and require significant consumer product &amp; design work, user education, and integrations from the
                wider world.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>technical</strong></p>

          <p>Here are some technical questions related to the Basis system and its implementation on the Ethereum
            blockchain:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>are the economics &amp; price stability mechanisms of Basis viable given the gas &amp; storage
                constraints? in my implementation, the cost to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">tick()</code> (the
                auction to re-balance the system) is expensive and scales linearly with the number of bond holders and
                share holders. who pays for the gas costs? how can this re-balancing happen more efficient at scale?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>does the frequency and cost of running the auction and re-balancing the economy impose a limit to
                Basis’s growth? Basis can only grow after an auction / re-balance. An auction / re-balance can only
                happen after enough shareholders have submitted their votes on the current USD-Basis coin price. The
                Ethereum blockchain presently processes only ~15 transactions per second. In the success case where
                there are thousands or millions of Basis users, oracle votes and operations related to the auction may
                consume an unreasonably large portion of total Ethereum transaction resources. There is ongoing work in
                Ethereum to improve transaction volume, but its not live yet. How does Basis handle this?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>How often does the economy need to re-balance for the coin prices to be stable? Or rather, what should
                we expect the relationship to be for time between reconciliations and
                price volatility to look like? How is this affected by the gas cost of re-balancing the coin supply? Is
                there any dynamic adaptation logic to control when auctions happen? My idea is to take as inputs:
                (N_current = # of oracle price votes by coin ownership), (N_last = # of oracle price votes by coin
                ownership at last reconciliation), (T_rec = time since last reconciliation) and trigger an auction then
                some threshold is met. The threshold starts at N_last and decays as T_rec increases.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>what incentive or penalty structure makes for accurate oracle guesses? how are oracle rewards balanced
                with needs to expand and contract coin supply? are there scenarios where oracles would want to bid
                dishonestly?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>what are the mechanics, sequencing, and frequency of the bond auctions, oracle price guessing, and
                expanding and contracting the coin supply? the sequencing of each of these will affect trade behavior
                and even currency stability. i punted this question- in my implementation, oracle price guessing and
                bonding bidding run continuously and supply contracts or expands at will at a call to <code
                  class="highlighter-rouge">tick()</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>in a contraction, what happens if there is insufficient bond demand? is there a risk of losing the peg
                or crashing if bond markets are not deep enough? in early days especially, what gives people confidence
                in the return of Basis to $1 amid a contracting supply? what’s the role of the pre-sale / ico funds
                here?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>in an expansion, what happens if <code
                  class="highlighter-rouge">(# of share holders) &gt;&gt;&gt; (# of coins for expansion)</code>? how can
                coins be distributed efficiently and fairly? e.g. smallest units of coin distributed randomly to share
                holders pro rata.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>what will share liquidity look like in early days? will pre-sale / ico investors be trading actively
                and have the tools to do so easily? does this matter?</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="on-cryptocurrency">On cryptocurrency</h4>

          <p>Below are some thoughts on Basis &amp; cryptocurrency broadly after working on my project. First, some of
            my favorite reading materials:</p>

          </ul>

          <p><strong>My soap box</strong>:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Required use cases for blockchains are limited and the “killer app” of the blockchain is money. The <a
                target="_blank" href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8202.pdf">NIST blockchain

                href="https://medium.com/swlh/blockchain-benefits-use-cases-d259c823e968">Siliski’s article</a> provide
              correct breakdowns of blockchain use cases. There are many creative blockchain projects, but money
              transfer is the single best application for a borderless, trustless, decentralized, anonymous ledger (i.e.
              blockchain).</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The convenience &amp; low cost of existing centralized products relative to new decentralized,
                blockchain-based products will inhibit growth of those decentralized products. Presently, most consumers
                are not concerned about the privacy / security / data-ownership features that many decentralized
                products espouse. Free, easy, frictionless, centralized consumer products are preferable to the
                presently expensive, cumbersome, irreversible decentralized products. I believe in most consumer
                domains, we will continue to trend towards more regulated centralized products rather than decentralized
                products with privacy built-in. Network effects &amp; moats of existing companies/products will make it
                difficult for new decentralized products to break in.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Some argue that after the cryptocurrency bubble pops, blockchain technology absent of cryptocurrency
                will prevail as the major accomplishment / salient feature of the era [needs citation]. This is wrong -
                they are currently inseparable. Perhaps I am arguing “blockchain” semantics here. A system that isn’t
                solving the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance">Byzantine
                  generals problem</a> of reaching consensus amongst unreliable actors isn’t a blockchain. Currently,
                the mining/cryptocurrency reward system is the only solution to this problem. Distributed, chained data
                stores are great (think <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code>), but blockchain implies distributed
                consensus.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>New “decentralized” systems can still trend towards centralization. In proof of work systems, mining
                can become centralized. Economies of scale make it cheaper for a few big players to build efficient,
                mass infrastructure. In proof of stake or distributed proof of stake systems, concentration of wealth
                and reliance on other actors again become issues. These problems are likely solvable, but are obstacles
                to the decentralized utopian narrative.</p>
